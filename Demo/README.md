CaerbannogSample
================

This repo contains a sample project to show how to use the Caerbannog swift package.  Caerbannog is a package which allows integrating Python directly into a macOS swift application.  It supports having Swift call Python code, as well as Python code calling back into Swift code.

The samples demonstrated in this application are:

1) using Numpy (for numerical and array manipulation)
2) using Boto (for managing AWS resources)
3) using Dominate (to generate HTML in Python)
4) running Matplotlib and capturing the resulting graphs as images in Swift
5) running Asciify, (which takes an image input into Python and generates an Ascii text rendering)
6) running GoogleimagesDownloads in Python

========================

Todo:i

1) generate a Python module in Swift which can be called from Python
2) write documentation for how to install and run these examples
